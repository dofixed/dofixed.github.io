## Install, launch, updates and uninstall

### Install

You can download the .zip file containing Dofixed installer by following [this link](https://github.com/dofixed/dofixed-install/archive/master.zip).

### Launch

Once Dofixed is installed, simply click on the shortcut created on your desktop to launch it. Dofixed will wait until a Dofus window is opened to start (spoil: if there is none, Dofixed is useless). Dofixed will close automatically at the closing of the associated Dofus window.

### Update

Whenever it starts, Dofixed checks for an update and proposes to install it automatically. After the update, Dofixed will restart on its own (there may be a few seconds where "nothing happens"). It's also possible to download the latest version and reinstall it manually. The installer will propose to uninstall the old version first.



### Uninstall

You can uninstall Dofixed at any time from the Windows uninstall program panel. Make sure Dofixed is **not** running before you do.

### No install replayer

If you wish to open a dfxr file created with Dofixed but do not wish to install the application, you can download a "no install" version of the replayer only by following [this link](https://github.com/dofixed/dofixed-replayer/archive/master.zip).

## Limitations

- Windows only
- You have to connect with port 5555 (in the connection window, the choice of port can be found after clicking on "advanced options").
- If you play with multiple accounts, Dofixed will ask you which window you want to associate to it to. Some functionalities start to be usable in case of multi-accounts though.
- Dofixed can not handle in game zoom


## Warnings

Dofixed has **not** been authorized officially by Ankama. The TOS of the game specify that it is forbidden to use third party tools, or to advertise them on the official game/forum. Dofixed therefore does **not** respect the TOS and a risk of ban is always present. Dofixed  team can not be held responsible in case of a ban.

**However**, Dofixed does not modify the game or its files, it only observes it and display information over it. It is in no way a bot and no action is automated. Therefore, the use of Dofixed is not detectable by Ankama than the use of other programs like Paint or Discord, and we would be very surprised to see a ban happening. Dofixed has been out since Septembre 2019, and, to our knowledge, no ban occured because of Dofixed.

**Our only objective is to improve the player experience, without modifying the game as designed by Ankama. All Dofixed features ideas are systematically submitted to Ankama, and we await their approval before deploying anything in Dofixed.**


### What if it is a hack thing?

This is a legitimate question. The real Dofixed application is 100% safe for your Dofus account (but that's also what a hacker would say :/). There is not really a way for us to certify the harmlessness of our application. The only thing we can say is that a scan on VirusTotal does not trigger any of the "big" anti-virus software. Usually, there are some minor alerts (Cylance and/or VBA32 sometimes, depending on the version), these are false positives.

At the end, it's up to you, if you don't want to use Dofixed, we won't force you to :D

### Blah blah blah

The Dofixed team is not responsible if your computer explodes, your hair falls or your loved one leaves.
